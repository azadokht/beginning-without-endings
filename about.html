    Once again, Iran is facing an uprising wave of protests, it started protesting the rise of the price of gasoline.
    These protests quickly became an outlet for broader frustrations; The joyless religious dictatorship.
    ‘Beginnings without endings, introduces a timeline of these events inspired by flags that are displayed in Iran
    during Ashura festivals, those flags are normally commemorating Hussain’s martyrdom, sayings of the prophet, verses
    from the Quran or quotes from Khomeini and other important figures. These phrases are replaced by the slogans and phrases
    used by the protesters who have been shut by the regime. The banners are a sign of grief to express the sadness of these events
    indicating the ungoing anger toward the Iranian government.
