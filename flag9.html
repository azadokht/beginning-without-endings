          Many students in Iran chanted anti-government slogans in several Iranian universities during the annual
          Student Day gathering. Pictures and videos posted on social media show students holding placards
          that read: "People's Tables Plundered in Bloody Month of Aban" in reference to the three-fold increase
          of gasoline price which led to mass protests throughout the country and left hundreds of protesters dead.
          In these videos students are seen chanting slogans about the killing of innocent people during
          November protests, students' unity with workers, people's resistance and against “neoliberalist”
          policies of the government.

          Students have also been changing slogans against various regime officials including President Hassan
          Rouhani who has avoided the Student Day gatherings this year and Chief Justice Ebrahim Raeesi who will
          be addressing a separate rally by Basij militia students at Tehran University. Student rallies have been held
          on December 7 to commemorate a rally in 1953 during which three students protesting the official visit of
          the U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon were killed.

            “Iran' s President claims that although Iranians have less food to eat on their table, they still support the regime.
            Well, Mr. Rouhani. How about the ones that protest? They're sentenced to many years in prison. Like Saba Kord-Afshari,
            Yasaman Aryani, and more. Iran's rulers are scared of the wrath of Iranians. The more they repress Iranians and lie about
            what they think, the more Iranians will protest.”<br>
