  Protests erupted across Iran continued, increasing pressure on the Islamic
  Republic’s leadership after it admitted its military shot down a Ukrainian airliner by accident,
  despite days of denials that Iranian forces were to blame. Residents of the capital told Reuters that police
  were out in force on Sunday. Some protesters in Azadi Square first called on officers there to join them,
  then turned their anger on the authorities, chanting anti-government slogans.

  Several students at the Isfahan sit-in held a sign saying “1,500 + 176”, referencing the number of people
  the U.S. government has accused Iran of killing in a crackdown on nationwide protests last November, plus the
  number of people killed in the crash of the Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737 jet. In videos surfacing on the internet,
  many Tehran university students openly refused to walk over the American and Israeli flags which was the symbol of
  the country’s foreign policy of anti-Americanism and anti-Zionism since the inception of the Islamic Republic.
  The flags had been painted on the road so that protesters would walk over them as they marched. In the central city of Isfahan
  the protest seemed to be a silent one, with many of those gathered wearing surgical white masks over their faces with black “X”
  marks to symbolize their voices being silenced.

            Are the few hundred people who disrespected posters of Iran's honorable Martyr General Soleimani “the people of Iran"? Or, are
            the millions who attended his funeral the Iranian people?<br>

          The so-called “Supreme Leader” of Iran, who has not been so Supreme lately, had some nasty things to say about the
          United States and Europe. Their economy is crashing, and their people are suffering. He should be very careful with his words!<br>
