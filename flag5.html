          Iran has admitted "unintentionally" shooting down a Ukrainian passenger jet, killing all 176 people on board.
          An investigation found that "missiles fired due to human error", President Hassan Rouhani said. He described
          the crash as an "unforgivable mistake". The military said the jet turned towards a sensitive site belonging to
          Iran's Revolutionary Guards and was then mistaken for a cruise missile. Iran had previously rejected suggestions
          that it was to blame. The downing of Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 came just hours
          after Iran carried out missile strikes on two airbases housing US forces in Iraq. The strikes were a response to
          the killing of senior Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike in Baghdad on 3 January.

        Flight tracking website FlightRadar24 showed the plane following its normal route and travelling at
        just over 500 kmh – far slower than a cruise missile. Nine flights had left Tehran’s Imam Khomeini
        international airport that morning before the Ukrainian airliner without encountering trouble.

       Protesters gathered outside Tehran's Amir Kabir university chanting "dishonorable," an apparent reference
       to Iranian leaders, while calling for justice over the shooting down of the plane. "Resignation is not enough," angry
       protesters chanted. "A trial is necessary." Some Iranians have asked why planes were allowed to fly over the
       Iranian capital hours after Iran launched a missile attack on two military bases housing U.S. forces in Iraq,
       which could have prompted retaliatory action by the United States. There was also criticism of what was
      widely seen as an initial attempt by the Iranian authorities to cover up the cause of the tragedy. Officials had been
      initially defiant in the face of multiple allegations by Western officials and a growing body of evidence
      from investigators that an Iranian missile had hit the Ukrainian plane.

      Iranians mourned the dead from the plane crash among whom were a large number of young people
      with promising futures who were studying abroad. Hundreds of students gathered at Tehran's Shahid Beheshti
      University to honour the victims and protest against authorities for concealing the cause of the crash.

              The so-called “Supreme Leader” of Iran, who has not been so Supreme lately, had some nasty things to say about the United States and Europe. Their economy is crashing, and their people are suffering. He should be very careful with his words!<br>

  The villainous US govt repeatedly says that they are standing by the Iranian ppl.
  They lie. If you are standing by the Iranian ppl, it is only to stab them in the heart with your venomous daggers.
  Of course, you have so far failed to do so, & you will certainly continue to fail.
