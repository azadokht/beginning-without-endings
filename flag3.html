          The Iranian government has banned the families of protesters killed during anti-government
          unrest in November from organizing any kind of funeral service or memorial for their children
          or loved ones.

          Iranians mourn their dead on the third, seventh and 40th days after a death. These commemorations
          are a fundamental part of Iranian culture and the Muslim world.

          Iranian security forces raided cemeteries as people mourned the deaths
          of protesters killed during a violent crackdown on anti-government demonstrations.
          The families of many protesters and victims have been threatened and warned not to speak to the
          media, some families were also being forced to make payments to have the bodies of their loved ones
          returned to them and have been kept from holding mourning ceremonies in honor of the protesters
          because the Iranian regime feared anti-regime gatherings. Many mourners were arrested and taken away.

       The parents of Mr. Bakhtiari were detained after refusing under pressure of the government to call off their
       invitation for the public to join their son's memorial service. Witnesses reported that security forces ordered
       family members to leave the cemetery. Chased supporters away, arrested several people. They blocked cars from entering
       the cemetery and positioned water cannons and armored cars around the grave site.

              To the leaders of Iran - DO NOT KILL YOUR PROTESTERS. Thousands have already been killed or imprisoned by you, and the World is watching. More importantly, the USA is watching. Turn your internet back on and let reporters roam free! Stop the killing of your great Iranian people!<br>
            @TheRealDonaldTrump

  The United States just spent Two Trillion Dollars on Military Equipment.
  We are the biggest and by far the BEST in the World! If Iran attacks an American Base,
   or any American, we will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their way...and without hesitation!
