          The day after the announced increase of the price of fuel, Iranians took to the
          streets in protest. And the Iranian government reacted to its citizens organizing by
          shutting down the internet for the whole country. Seeking to silence the protesters and unrest.
          The protests, which came amid a worsening of the economic situation due to crippling U.S. sanctions,
          quickly spread to some 100 cities and towns across the country where government buildings and public
          property including banks, gas stations, shops, ATMs, and several seminaries were set on fire.
          Violent clashes were reported in many places, leaving an unknown number of dead.

          Protesters largely chanted against the gas-price hike, which they say will make the poor even poorer.
          But the demonstrations quickly turned political with some of the protesters targeting the clerical
          establishment in their slogans, including chants of "Mullahs get lost," "Death to Khamenei," and
          "We do not want the Islamic republic." Posters of Khamenei or symbols associated with Iran's supreme
          leader were also spotted being set alight.

          The protests are considered the most serious since the December 2017-January
          2018 anti-establishment demonstrations that spread to more than 80 cities.
          The current wave of protests also appear to be more violent that those countrywide
          rallies that started nearly two years ago. The establishment has pushed back hard with force, deploying
          thousands of security forces, including members of the riot police and the IRGC across the country to
          quell the protests. Security forces have reportedly used tear gas to disperse protesters and there
          are several reports many including photos or video of live ammunition being used against
          demonstrators and of shooting at protesters from the rooftops of government buildings.

          NetBlocks, which monitors worldwide Internet access, said on November 19 that
          connectivity in Iran had fallen to just 4 percent of ordinary levels, meaning nearly every
          Iranian is unable to go online. They also reported that the loss was about $2.5 billion for the Iranian economy.

          Meanwhile, as the whole country has seemingly been forced offline, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei tweeted
          in support of the government’s decision to increase fuel prices. Khamenei’s online presence
          (and other top leaders) caused outrage amongst Iranians who have been unable to get in touch with their
          friends and family.
          The internet is considered a lifeline between Iranians and the diaspora. Millions depend on
          international social messaging apps, such as WhatsApp and Telegram, to stay in touch with
          friends and family. But with the internet shutdown, people with loved ones in Iran had no way of
          knowing whether their friends and family were safe.

       The government never published the official death toll or the number of injured, but according to
       human rights organizations more than 400 people were killed and thousands were arrested by government forces.
       According to international rights organizations 450 people are believed to have been killed.
       At least 2,000 were reported injured, and 7,000 detained. As Iran's Supreme Leader
       Ali Khamenei ordered the protests to be crushed. "Do whatever it takes to end it," he is quoted as saying.

            Iran has become so unstable that the regime has shut down their entire Internet System
            so that the Great Iranian people cannot talk about the tremendous violence taking place within the country...
<br><br>
            ...They want ZERO transparency, thinking the world will not find out the death and tragedy that the Iranian
            Regime is causing!<br>
