          US-Iran tensions have peaked with the assassination of Qassem Soleimani,
          a 62-year-old who headed the foreign arm of the Islamic Revolution Guard
          Corps, Iran's elite military force. At the direction of US President Donald Trump,
          the US military killed Soleimani, head of Iran's Quds Force, the foreign arm of the IRGC,
          in the early hours of Friday January 3 2020, in an air raid near the cargo area of Baghdad
          International Airport.

          US-Iran tensions have been rising since Washington pulled out of a landmark nuclear agreement
          with Tehran last year and began reimposing punishing sanctions. And those tensions have escalated.
          After the assasination Iran calls for revenge. And have raised fears of a military conflict between Iran and the US.
          The US Department of Defense said in its statement that the killing was
          "aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans" as it warned it would take "all necessary action"
          to protect Americans and the country's interests around the world.

          Of course, people across the political divide were concerned about war.
          Nobody wants President Trump to bomb Iran’s cultural or historical sites
          as he threatened in a tweet. But the protesters had harsh words for Soleimani and his foreign adventures,
          chanting against Iran’s involvement in Syria and its support of Hezbollah.
          That came as a shock to the regime, which portrays Soleimani as Supreme Leader Ayatollah
          Ali Khamenei’s adopted son. Without doubt, Soleimani had support among hard-liners
          and regime loyalists. The regime is not taking any chances, though. In the city of Ahvaz,
          where large numbers of people turned out to mourn Soleimani, the government has
          forced students and officials to attend. It provided free transport and ordered shops to shut down.
          There are many Iranian voices who think Soleimani was a war criminal, but western media does not cover this.

          The killing of Soleimani dramatically escalated tensions between Tehran and Washington,
          following months of hostilities since Trump withdrew from a nuclear pact between Iran and world powers
          in 2018 and then toughened up sanctions.

          ....targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago),
          some at a very high level & important to Iran &  the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself,
          WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD. The USA wants no more threats!

<br><br>
           With their turnout in the 10s of millions for Martyr #Soleimani's funeral, the Iranian nation showed
           they support #resistance against the enemy’s aggression.
           These American clowns lie in utter viciousness that they stand with the Iranian people. See who
           the people of #Iran are.<br>
