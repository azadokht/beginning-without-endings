          Protesters in two Iranian cities chanted anti-regime slogans at funeral
          ceremonies for the victims of the Ukrainian plane downed by the Revolutionary Guards last week.
          The Iranian security bodies have tried to take over the funerals of the plane crash victims in an apparent
          attempt to prevent them from turning into anti-regime protests.

            In Isfahan and Sanandaj where on Thursday thousands of people gathered for the ceremonies,
            protesters chanted "Down with the dictator", a reference used to supreme Leader Ali Khamenei during
            protests. Regime agents mobilized by the Revolutionary Guard's Basij militia tried to drawn the protesters
            voices by turning up loudspeakers that broadcast funeral Qoran recitations and eulogies for Qods Force Commander
            Qassem Soleimani who was killed by the United States a few days before the plane crash. According to some social
            media reports when the ceremonies ended, security forces cracked down on the protesters in Isfahan where a mass
            funeral was held on Thursday for 11 victims of the crash. Some reports say the militia vigilantes attacked the
            participants with tasers and chanted pro-regime slogans.

            After the Revolutionary Guard accepted responsibility for downing the Ukrainian plane the regime bestowed
            the title of "martyr" on victims. In Sanandaj, however, on Wednesday and Thursday the families of several
            crash victims refused to allow their coffins to be draped in the flag of the Islamic Republic or the bodies
            to be buried in a part of the city's cemetery allocated to "martyrs". "Stop using nooses [to hang people],
            stop your atrocities" and "Death on tyrants, whether shahs or supreme leaders," participants in these funerals
            chanted in their native Kurdish language who also chanted slogans against Khamenei.

                    The villainous US govt repeatedly says that they are standing by the Iranian ppl. They lie.
                    If you are standing by the Iranian ppl, it is only to stab them in the heart with your venomous daggers.
                    Of course, you have so far failed to do so, & you will certainly continue to fail.<br>

                   The noble people of Iran—who love America—deserve a government that's more interested in helping them achieve their
                   dreams than killing them for demanding respect. Instead of leading Iran toward ruin, its leaders should abandon terror
                   and Make Iran Great Again!<br>
