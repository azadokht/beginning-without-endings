  An Iranian human rights group reported that a court has sentenced five individuals
  arrested during November protests to a total of thirty years in prison as well as flogging and exile. Iranian authorities
  have not officially announced how many were arrested during the protests in November. It is also not clear how many of
  the arrested protesters are still being held in detention. Some of the protesters, however, have been put on trial in
  various regions.

According to Radio Farda's investigations of separate announcements made by local authorities at least
8000 were arrested during the protests. Verified videos show security forces deliberately shooting unarmed protesters at
close range. In some cases, protesters were shot while running away and clearly posing no threat to security forces.
Other videos show the security forces shooting towards protesters from the rooftops of state buildings, including a
justice department building. Security forces responsible for the crackdown include Iran’s police force, the Revolutionary
Guards, and plainclothes agents from the Basij paramilitary force. The majority of the deaths that the organization has
recorded occurred as a result of gunshots to the head, heart, neck and other vital organs indicating that the security
forces were shooting to kill.The UN has stated that it has information suggesting that at least 23 children are among those
killed.

  Amnesty has also received reports that the Iranian authorities have moving injured protesters from
  hospitals to detention facilities, putting their lives at risk by denying them potentially life-saving medical care.
  Amnesty has also received information indicating that, in many cases, the Iranian authorities have refused to
  return victims’ bodies to their families and, in some cases, the security forces have removed dead bodies from
  morgues and transferred them to unknown locations.There are also shocking reports that, when the authorities have returned victims’ bodies to their families,
  they have demanded payment citing several reasons, including the cost of the bullet that killed their loved one,
  or compensation for property destroyed during the protests.

  Iran social media users have shared shocking images of bodies recovered from dams,
  reservoirs and rivers that allegedly belong to November protesters more than a month after the deadliest
  unrest in the history of the Islamic Republic. The images show swollen bodies, many of them with hands tied.
  Most of the mind-boggling images are from the oil-rich province of Khuzestan and Kurdish-populated areas in
  the west of the country. Radio Farda's report says that security and intelligence agents have forced families to say that they have comitted suicide by throwing themselves in the reservoirs.

         40 years of corruption. 40 years of repression. 40 years of terror. The regime in Iran has produced only #40YearsofFailure.
         The long-suffering Iranian people deserve a much brighter future.<br>

We are not against the people of the US. What we are against is the rule of oppression, rebellion, and arrogance.
Today, the epitome of rebellion, arrogance and tyranny is the US government, which is controlled by the wealthy Zionist individuals and corporate owners.<br>
