        <p>Protests in Iran began on Friday 15 November 2019, due to the government’s announcement that the
          price of petrol would increase by 50% to 15,000 rials per liter and there would be a limit on the
          total number of liters available for each car. The government has justified this price increase by
          stating the additional revenue would be allocated to Iranian citizens in need of cash subsidies.
          However, this has created strong outrage among the Iranian people, with many of their anger directed
          towards the government.</p>
<br>
        <p>There are images of protestors burning the Iranian flag on busy freeways and shouting for the overthrow of the
          government. Protestors have attacked and set fire to government buildings and state-run banks. Iran’s leader, Ayatollah
          Ali Khamenei, has been particularly targeted by protestors, who criticize the leader for living in luxury
          while the majority of the country lives in poverty. Iranian officials have responded disproportionately to
          these protests by shooting tear gas, firearms, and water cannons at the protestors; there have even been
          reports of snipers being used against the protestors.

           <p>The Iranian people’s dissatisfaction towards the Iranian government stems from the current economic
             turmoil in the country, one that has worsened due to the United States reinstating sanctions on the
             country last year. However, while the US sanctions on the country have caused the price increase of
             many commodities, it is the weak structural foundation of the Iranian economy and the government’s
             management of it that has resulted in this strong reaction from the people. Protests over the economic
             conditions within Iran have plagued the country for the past several years. Since 2017, there have been
             numerous and repeated protests over the economic policies of the country, building on top of existing
             distrust and resentment of the government. While these protests have originally begun due to increased
             prices of basic goods, it has been used to additionally protest the corruption of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
             and his government. These protests have proven to be one of the biggest organized protests against the
             government since 1979, with more than a million Iranian citizens taking to the street for the past several years.
             As the protests continue, the Iranian government should reconsider its domestic economic policies to ensure the support of the people.

        Naming this week, the “#UnityWeek” in the Islamic Republic is not just putting a name, nor a political tactic.
        It is a heartfelt belief. The Islamic Republic truly believes in the need for the #unity of the #IslamicNation.<br>
      @Khamenei.ir
<br><br>
    To the brave, long-suffering people of Iran: I've stood with you since the beginning of my Presidency, and my Administration
    will continue to stand with you. We are following your protests closely, and are inspired by your courage.<br>
